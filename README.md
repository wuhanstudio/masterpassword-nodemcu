## What's this?

Always want to find a password manager, yet still considering security problems? Thanks to <a href="http://masterpasswordapp.com/">Master Password</a>, now here comes a solution.

Your passwords are generated instantly and will **never** be stored anywhere.


> No Storage - Nothing To Intercept - Nothing to Lose

This project makes it possible to take it with you everywhere like this :

Wow, a pretty cute tiny password manager. It generates a wireless network which you can connect  with :

        SSID: masterpassword
        PSK : masterpassword

Then open your favorite browser and navigate to :

        http://192.168.111.1

Here it is :

Now you can generate your passwords instantly. Of course, nothing is gonna to be stored in it thus nothing to lose even if someone else got this module. 

## How it works

Actually I just fit <a href="https://github.com/tmthrgd/mpw-js.git"> mpw-js</a> into esp8266 with 50K RAM and 1MB flash storage. I'm using <a href="http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html">nodemcu</a> to run a tiny <a href="https://github.com/marcoskirsch/nodemcu-httpserver.git">http server</a> written in lua script language. You can find more useful resources at the bottom.

## Prerequisites

You can just use your favorite esp8266 module. As for now, I've tested all of these modules.

Then clone the source code and have fun. 

    git clone https://github.com/wuhanstudio/masterpassword-nodemcu.git
    
    git submodule init && git submodule update 

Oh, Remember you need **Python**. 

## How to install

0. Check out your serial port and modify **Makefile**

    For Linux :
        
        PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0

    For Windows :

        PORT=COM5

1. Erase your flash

    Though this is not necessary but recommended. 
        
        sudo make clean
    
    - For Linux, you need **sudo** to get access to serial connection.  

    - For Windows, **sudo** is not necessary.

        

2. Copy files

    This will get all configuration files ready.

        sudo make install

3. Upload Firmware

        sudo make upload_firmware

4. Upload Server and HTML files

        sudo make upload_all 

5. Done, now connect to it and open your favorite browser

        SSID: masterpassword       PSK : masterpassword

        http://192.168.111.1
